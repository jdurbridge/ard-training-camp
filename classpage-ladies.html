                    <h1>Ladies only Boxing For Fitness</h1>
                    <h2>Get fit and learn a new skill in a fun and no pressure environment</h2>
                    <h3>No selie queens here!</h3>
                    <p>This class is specifically designed for ladies looking to improve their fitness whilst enjoying the fun of learning a new skill. The class is run by fellow member Jemma Durbridge who has trained at A.R.D for over 15 years and is a qualified Personal Trainer. Jemma understands that boxing gyms can seem intimidating and a bit daunting so she has forced us to close the doors to anyone else other than her ladies to ensure complete privacy allowing you to relax, let your hair down and no doubt sing along to the cheesy 90’s tunes along the way. Quote: ‘Keeping fit can be fun and no one should be made to feel uncomfortable which is why I set up this class, for women to support other women – absolutely no selfie Queens here!!’</p>
                   
                    <p>Andre is a former British, European and World Kickboxing Champion who graduated in 1999 with a degree in Psychology. Throughout his studies, Andre used his newly developed Psychology skills and knowledge to help him win both European and World titles, after having won the British title before his studies began. However, since earning his degree and prestigious Kickboxing titles, Andre has gone on to use Psychology to help people in all walks of life - whether in sport or in their personal lives.</p>
                
                    <p>If you feel like a Psychology session could help and benefit you, then please give Andre a call for an informal chat!</p>
