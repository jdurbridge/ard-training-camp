            <h1>Privacy and Terms</h1>

                 <h2>Terms</h2>

                 <h3>1. GENERAL TERMS AND CONDITIONS</h3>
                 <p>In these Terms & Conditions and the Club Rules, "ARD" means A.R.D Training Camp Ltd, company number xxxxx and whose registered office is at xxxxxxxx; "Member" means the member named on the Application Form, and "Membership" is the membership by a Member of a Club, which starts when ARD accepts the proposed Member's Application Form; "Club" means the ARD gym at which the Member applied for membership may attend; "Contract" means the contract between ARD and the Member subject to these Terms & Conditions and Club Rules; "Application Form" means the application form completed by the Member to join the Club; "Club Rules" means the terms set out in the ARD Club Rules.</p>

                 <h3>2. MEMBERSHIP APPLICATION</h3>
                 <p>Membership is subject to these Terms & Conditions as amended from time to time. Submission of an Application Form is an offer to ARD to become a Member of the Club subject to these Terms & Conditions and the club rules. ARD reserves the right to reject any application for Membership.</p>
                 <p>Membership is available to individuals of 18 years of age and over, subject to status.</p>


                

                <h3>3. CANCELLING YOUR MEMBERSHIP</h3>
                <p>Members on a Monthly Minimum Term Membership contract may cancel their Membership after or with effect from the end of the minimum term, by giving one full calendar month's advance written notice, effective from the 1st of the following month. This should be done by contacting the gym team. 

                An ARD team member will respond to all cancellation requests. If confirmation of cancellation is not received, the Member is responsible for re-submitting the cancellation request.

                <p>Where the payment method is Direct Debit, the Member must advise their bank to cancel the Direct Debit instruction after the final payment has been made. ARD is not obliged to refund any fees where the Member has not cancelled the instruction and cannot provide proof of a valid cancellation request. All fees must be paid to date at the time of cancellation.</p>

                Paid in Full Memberships will expire automatically at the end of the term, unless the Member chooses to renew their Membership. No refunds are applicable for any portion of fees paid upfront, excluding in the following circumstances: redundancy, permanent illness and permanent injury preventing gym usage. Valid documentation will be requested as proof in such circumstances.

                <p>All Members who opt for a No Commitment Membership can terminate their Membership by cancelling the direct debit authorisation directly through their bank or building society. It is the Members responsibility to ensure enough notice is provided to the bank/building society to prevent the next payment. ARD recommends at least 5 working days. Cancellations cannot be backdated and payments taken successfully will not be refunded. When a direct debit payment is unsuccessful, access will be denied with immediate effect and the Membership will be terminated within two working days. Should a Member wish to continue a Membership following a failed direct debit they may contact the gym team to discuss available options.</p>

                <p>Should a Member be unable to use the Club for the remainder of the term, the Member may apply to transfer the Contract to another person. The Member is responsible for finding someone, who is not already a Member of a ARD Club, to take over the balance of the Membership. A Transfer Fee will apply as per the Club's current price schedule. Both the existing Member (where possible) and the new Member must attend the Club to complete the transfer application, which will not be deemed complete until a Membership Application Form has been completed and signed by the new proposed Member and ARD has accepted that person as a Member.</p>

                Members still within the minimum contractual period may reduce their cancellation notice to one full calendar month in the following circumstances: Pregnancy, Redundancy, Permanent injury and Permanent illness preventing gym usage. Valid documentation will be requested as proof in such circumstances.

                Any Member with three or more months remaining of the minimum term may terminate their Membership at the end of the then current month by paying in full 50% of the total future fees due until the end of the minimum term.</p>


                <h3>4. PERSONAL TRAINING</h3>
                <p>The Personal Trainers (PT) that operate within Club are not employees of ARD, but are self-employed, independent freelance trainers. In using a PT you are entering into an agreement with the PT alone and not with ARD.

                <h3>5. TERMINATION OF MEMBERSHIP BY ARD</h3>
                <p>ARD may terminate a Membership without notice and with immediate effect if:

                The Member breaches these Terms & Conditions or the Club Rules, either repeatedly or because of one serious breach;
                Any due fees remain unpaid after any request for payment by ARD;
                ARD is of the opinion (acting in its discretion) that the Member is not suitable for continued Membership;
                The Member puts the health, safety or well-being of staff or other Members or Guests at risk.
                All decisions made by ARD under this clause are final and binding. ARD is unlikely to accept a new application for Membership from someone whose Membership has been terminated in accordance with this clause.</p>

                <h3>6. YOUR PERSONAL INFORMATION</h3>  
                <p>ARD acknowledge that the security of a Members personal information is of high importance. ARD Privacy Policy conforms to the European Union General Data Protection Regulation (EU GDPR) effective as of 25th May 2018 and explains how a Members information is processed at ARD and the rights a Member has as an individual under the GDPR.

                Members are responsible for advising ARD of changes to their personal information. Should a Member wish to update their personal information and/or request a change of Membership, this must be requested using the registered email address within the ARD database for that Member. Where ARD is required to provide any written or email notification, ARD will send the notice to the contact information on the Application Form, or any updated contact information the Member has provided since joining.

                Please ensure you have read and understand the ARD Privacy Policy prior to accepting the Terms of your Agreement.</p>


                <h3>7. LIMITATION OF LIABILITY</h3>
                <p>Nothing in these Terms & Conditions shall limit or exclude ARD’s liability for:

                (i) death or personal injury caused by its negligence, or the negligence of its personnel or agents;

                (ii) fraud or fraudulent misrepresentation; or

                (iii) any other liability which cannot be limited or excluded by applicable law.

                Subject to that:

                (a) ARD shall have no liability to the Member or Guest, whether in contract, tort (including negligence), breach of statutory duty, or otherwise, for any indirect or consequential loss arising under or in connection with these Terms & Conditions; and

                (b) ARD’s total liability to the Member or Guest, whether in contract, tort (including negligence), breach of statutory duty, or otherwise, arising under or in connection with these Terms & Conditions shall be limited to £250.</p>


                <h3>8. CHANGES TO ARD TERMS & CONDITIONS</h3>
                <p>ARD may from time to time amend these Terms & Conditions, including the introduction of any additional terms and conditions, and will notify Members by placing a notice on the Club noticeboard. Any changes will be effective immediately.</p>


                <h3>9. GOVERNING LAW AND JURISDICTION</h3>
                <p>These Terms & Conditions, and any dispute or claim arising out of or in connection with them or their subject matter or formation (including non-contractual disputes or claims), shall be governed by, and construed in accordance with the law of England and Wales.

                Each party irrevocably agrees that the courts of England and Wales shall have exclusive jurisdiction to settle any dispute or claim arising out of or in connection with these Terms & Conditions or their subject matter or formation (including non-contractual disputes or claims).</p>
